This is a web application which I built using AWS Web Console from AWS - Learn Build a Basic web application.

What I learnt:

1. Deploy static resources for your web application using the AWS Amplify Console.
2. Build a serverless function using AWS Lambda.
3. Deploy your serverless function with API Gateway.
4. Persist data in an Amazon DynamoDB table.
5. Modify your web app to invoke your API.
